# Predictive-Analysis-of-Housing-Sale-Price-Using-Data-Mining
Using the housing sale dataset of Ames, Iowa, this project tries to predict sale price of the house based on various predictors. This project starts with the exploratory data analysis, and later data preprocessing including data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, data encoding. Finally the model is trained using different Machine Learning Algorithms and the best model with the highest predictive power is identified.
