# Predictive-Analysis-of-Housing-Sale-Price-Using-Data-Mining
Using the housing sale dataset of Ames, Iowa, this project tries to predict sale price of the house based on various predictors. This project starts with the exploratory data analysis, and later data preprocessing including data cleaning, dimensionality reduction, data encoding and feature selection. Finally the model is trained using different Machine Learning Algorithms and the best model with the highest predictive power is identified.

This project is being carried out in stages:

Stage 1. Data Collection and Processing

Stage 2. Data Exploration and Visualization

Stage 3. Model Exploration and Model Selection

Stage 4. Model Implementation

Stage 5. Model Performance Evaluation and Visualization
